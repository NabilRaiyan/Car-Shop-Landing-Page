# **🚗 Car Shop Landing Page**

Welcome to the Car Shop Landing Page! This is a responsive and dynamic web application built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, featuring a powerful integration with the Car API from RapidAPI by API Ninja. The page allows users to easily search for cars based on brand and model, as well as filter results by gas type and year.

## Features 🛠️
- **Search by Brand:** Easily search for cars by entering the brand name.
- **Search by Model:** Find specific car models by name.
- **Filter by Gas Type:** Filter cars by gas type (e.g., gasoline, diesel, etc.).
- **Filter by Year:** Narrow down your search to specific years of production.
- **Responsive Design:** Built with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, responsive layout.

## Tech Stack 🚀
- **Next.js:** A React framework for building static and dynamic websites.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive UI design.
- **Car API by API Ninja:** A free API that provides detailed car data like brand, model, year, fuel type, and more.
